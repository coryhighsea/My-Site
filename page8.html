        <p>I was in Amsterdam for only two nights but it was definitely a good time. It seems to be most peoples 
            go to spot in Europe which I agree. I was there in the winter so it ended up snowing on my last day there, which I dont
            think it snows there often. I will return to this city and most likely have warmer weather. I don't partake in the 
            Mary Jane but I can avoid it enough. I heard some of the weed candies in the kiosks are fake so beware of that
            just a tourst trap.

        <p>I did a free walking tour in Amsterdam, it is always my go to tourst thing to do in a city. You donate on what
            you think the tour is worth and they usually do a pretty good job. The one I did in Amsterdam was quite good. I am definitely glad 
            I ended up doing one since I was only there for a short time.
