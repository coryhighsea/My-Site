		<h2 class="text">About Me</h2>
		<p>Last year I quit my job and bought a one way ticket to Europe. I travelled for a month then found a job as a bartender in Cologne. 
			I also worked as a walking tour guide which allowed me to meet lots of people. While I was living there I was able to travel
			to a few other countries as well. I recently moved back to Canada to work as a field supervisor for a six month contract.
			I will be going back to Europe in January on a way ticket again and going to travel as much as I can. 
		</p>
		<p>I have been teaching myself software development through different resources. I have built this site myself with html, css, bootstrap and javascript. 
			I am hoping to make this a career I can do remote to continue to travel.

                in Kelowna, British Columbia. During school and after I graduated I worked a few 
                different jobs in different industries. I worked in sales for Hydraulics and industrial
                components for 1.5 years. Currently the work I am doing is Civil Engineering in a 
				field role. I like to practice software development in my spare time. I made this site to showcase the software development skills 
			I have aquired. Along with writing about my travels. adding for a test </p> -->
