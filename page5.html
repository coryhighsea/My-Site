		<h2>Less is More</h2>
		<p>When I decided to move to Germany I decided to take on a minimalist lifestyle. I donated and sold everything I owned. I sold my guns and guitars which I had for awhile so it was a bit tough. At the same time it was liberating. I sold my truck all my sports gear. I donated a lot of clothes, probably 5 garbage bags worth of clothes. I had two checked bags a 50 litre backpack and a duffle bag plus the small carry on bag. Now looking back on it I wish I brought even less. When I settled down in an apartment I had to acquire a few things. Proper towels, not just the travel microfibre towel. Some books along with more clothes. But for the most part I was able to live fine for 8 months off less. </p>

		<p>When I was packing for Canada I would have one checked bag and one carry on so I had to donate clothes again. I got rid of clothes that I brought to Germany but never wore. I will probably have to purchase some more work clothes now that I am back in Canada. There is a bit of a cycle of donating and re-buying clothes. I think it is okay to buy used clothes and donate it in the bins. Seems like a sustainable lifestlye.</p>
		<p>What I have learned from this is that less is more. Living off less gives you so much more appreciation for life. Having less clutter in your life is good for mental and physical health. Being able to focus on what matters and what you are passionate about. Plus it makes is a lot easier to travel and move when you don't have a lot of stuff. There is this mentality that we need to buy more products and more stuff. Work more to spend more to work more just is not a cycle I want to find myself in. If we can live off less then we can work less. Which I think is the way of the future.</p>
