<p class="text">I am a Mechanical Engineer graduate from the Univeristy of British Columbia Okanagan. I have worked in many
	different industries since graduating. Right now I am working as a Field Supervisor in the Civil Engineering Industry. 
	I like to program in my spare time and I have been putting that as my main side focus. I built this site with HTMl CSS and Javascript.
</p>

<p>

	One page I have created on my site is <a href="page4.html">Cities I've Visited</a> and it has an interactive map with the cities I 
	have visited. Some of the pins have pictures or just the name of the city. I can implement this feature on your website or set it up locally.
	There are a lot of other features that can done with the mapping. If you have a mapping need I can help.
