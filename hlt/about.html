 <div class="desc">

    <p>"I graduated from the University of British Columbia Okanagan in Mechanical Engineering in 2016. My favorite classes were always calculus based ones.
        In first year taking calculus one and two were my best grades. I have always enjoyed math and especially calculus. I know taking calculus in first year
        can be challenging and difficult. I can help you overcome those hurdles and guide you to success. I can help with physics and calculus based classes.
        You can email me to book a consultation for anything you may be struggling with."
